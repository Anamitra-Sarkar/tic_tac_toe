# Holographic Tic-Tac-Toe

Holographic Tic-Tac-Toe is a visually striking and interactive web-based implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Developed as part of frontend practice projects, it demonstrates modern UI/UX design, responsive layouts, and engaging game logic using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features a futuristic aesthetic, sound effects, and optional AI-powered gameplay and analysis.

## Features

- **Player vs Player** and **Player vs AI** modes
- Responsive, holographic-themed interface with custom fonts and glowing effects

- Sound effects using Tone.js for enhanced user experience
- AI opponent powered by the minimax algorithm for optimal gameplay
- Scoreboard tracking wins, losses, and draws in Player vs AI mode
- Gemini API integration for witty, dramatic post-game analysis (and in `tictactoe1.html`, AI hints for best moves)
- No backend or server required—fully client-side

## Technologies Used
